PokeWordle is a web game for Pokemon fan, that challenges the user to guess the Pokemon for the day, through a series of clues from every guess. Drawing inspiration from Wordle, PokeWordle uses the same concept except instead of letters, the characteristics of the Pokemon will be the Gen they're from, How many Evolution levels they have, their color, Geography, Legendary or not, can be Mega Evolved or not. Each day, the Pokemon to guess will be refreshed with a brand new Pokemon, allowing with a different experience everyday, ranging from OG Pokemon to new Pokemon from Gen 9. I will use data from the Pokemon API to make sure the game is as clean and authenticate as it can be. I also hope to be able to add an option for casual Pokemon players and hardcore players, so everyone who loves the Pokemon community can enjoy this game.
